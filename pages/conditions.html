            <h2>AGE & LICENSE REQUIREMENTS</h2>
            <p>All renters must be at least 21 years old and present a valid driverâ€™s license held for a minimum of 12 months prior to the rental date. Drivers under the age of 25 may be subject to a young driver surcharge. Additionally, non-EU citizens may be required to present an International Driving Permit along with their national license.</p>

            <h2>INSURANCE & PROTECTION</h2>
            <p>Basic insurance is included with every rental to meet the minimum legal requirements. For added peace of mind, renters have the option to purchase additional coverage such as Collision Damage Waiver (CDW) and Theft Protection. These optional plans significantly reduce or eliminate financial liability in case of damage or theft and are available for an extra daily charge. Choosing extended coverage is recommended, especially for long-distance travel or unfamiliar road conditions.</p>

            <h2>FUEL POLICY</h2>
            <p>Vehicles are handed over to customers with a full tank of fuel, and it is expected that they are returned in the same condition, with a full tank. In the event that the vehicle is returned with less fuel than it was provided, the missing fuel will be charged at the current fuel price. Additionally, a refueling fee will be applied to cover the costs of filling the tank. This policy ensures that the vehicle remains ready for the next customer without any disruption.</p>

            <p>A refundable deposit is required at pick-up, which will be blocked on your credit card and released when the vehicle is returned without damage. Additional drivers must meet the same requirements as the primary renter and be listed in the rental agreement. Extra charges may apply for additional drivers.</p>

          <p>Renters are fully responsible for any traffic, parking, or toll violations incurred during the rental period. If the vehicle is taken across international borders, prior written approval is required. Unauthorized cross-border travel may result in penalties or invalidation of insurance.
